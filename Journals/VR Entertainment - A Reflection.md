For the last three months, my world's perspective revolved around a single thread - a virtual reality development project. This period of narrow focus, in retrospect, washed me on heavy duty and tumble dried me many times over. However, in many ways this is an opportunity to come out fresh and clean, ironing out the wrinkles before they set in. I want to reflect on what went well, what went poorly, and what answers I am still searching for. 

### What Was I Up To?

## How Did it Affect Me?

### The Bad

### The Good

Although there were days where I felt like pulling my hair out, there is much to be said about the major benefits of a high-pressure situation which I shouldn't have found myself in. Emerging onto the bench, I finally have time to crack open some other forms of media and regain my focus on other threads. 
### The... Ugly? Maybe?
