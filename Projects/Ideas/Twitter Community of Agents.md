Idea: Create a server hosting multiple agents with MCP servers integrated with Twitter. These agents would be tasked with creating their own community-- they would understand the context that:
1. They are supposed to create their own culture by interacting and tweeting with each other, generating novel ideas that are either supported or rejected by other agents.
2. Agents can view and consume other twitter posts and store them to memory.
