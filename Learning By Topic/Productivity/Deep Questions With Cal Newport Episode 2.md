## Raw Notes
- be bored
- read
- teddy roosevelt focus sprints

- Writing: book writing process is hierarchical:
	- float ideas on short form writing
	- find ideas that gain traction / have more gravity
	- do heavy research on idea at broad scope
	- create a proposal of what should be in the book
	- compile that proposal into the book structure and finalize
	- build the book, chapter by chapter, doing intense research on the side for each chapter
	- 1-2 years total of research time allocated

- deep work is often discouraged at knowledge work organizations
		- this often stems from how work is delegated
		- The worst scenario is slack,  teams, emai
		- The rate of the requests is too sporadic and unorganized 
		- Delegated work requires structure in order to allow employees to work efficiently
	- The solution requires someone having ownership over work distribution and scheduling

- Using social media effectively
	- Optimize social media use
	- To Optimize:
		- Determine your goals
		- Consider the best plan for achieving that goal
		- If social media can boost that goal (e.g a facebook group, a social media blog), fine tune your feed to only show what’s relevant
	- Avoid general social media use as it will cause you to fall into a trap of unproductive time 

- Your life will be better if you do the hard things that matter every day, even if you don’t want to

- Log your deep work hours in daily journals

- Idea: log focus sprints in journal every day, track progress until you get to an hour and a half
