In a digital age it is hard to keep your focus. In a ep. 298 of Cal Newport's *Deep Questions* podcast, Newport provides historical examples of how our mode of information consumption radically changes how our brains see the world. This idea resonates with my inability to focus or pursue goals. Instead of blindly shaking my fist at the digital age, I instead sat without distraction for 5 minutes, and instead of wanting to scroll on my phone, I decided I would take the step to explore ideas expressed by Newport.

Newport explores some interesting ideas around finding motivation in your life, alluding to a chain of thinking which will allow for deeper meaning. In this chain of thinking, he outlines the first step to be putting devices out of site. This technique inspired me to write this journal entry. When I put my computer aside, my brain immediately though of my phone- then my laptop- then games- but not a book; the best I got was writing about this problem. The next step is the consumption of knowledge. He argues that this consumption is important in that it provides various, deep viewpoints of the world. Unlike shallow content, theses viewpoints raise deep emotional connections at times. This intuition, however, is incomplete with step 3: analysis of values. Understanding what, from these sources, resonates with oneself, helps elucidate what one's values are. In analyzing the experiences of others, you then can explore what you value in your life. This is a *Life Centric Plan*

I want to explore Newport's idea of a Life Centric Plan, where one asks, "what do I actually want in certain parts of my life?" or "what is the image I want to build?" by first looking back and observing what my values have been in the past.
